This is in LowSec. From there we will jump it to<a href="showinfo:56//60013501"> CIS-7X VII - Intaki Syndicate Bureau.<br></a>Max Size for Contracts is 120k m³. Pls don't go nuts with the Collaterals (100mio <b>max</b>) or we won't accept the Contracts. And pls if it's worth less than 100mio, set the appropriate collateral.<br><br>The Fee including Fuel-Costs will be 50isk/m³. I advise you to package your stuff, so that it will be small and less costly..<br>Issue a courier contract to<a href="showinfo:2//280942737"> Xtreme Insidious Corporation</a> using the above mentioned stations. Concerning deadlines: 2 weeks for accepting the courier contract, 2 weeks for completion of the courier contract. We will only jump if there is enough to jump and if it is safe to jump.<br><br>If it is taking too long for you, during the first 2 weeks you can still cancel the contract. I know everyone is still shocked and doesn't trust easily.. if what you want to transport to CIS- is too valuable, don't let us do it at this time.<br><br>Cheers<br>Goerkon Grida]]></row>

Why lowsec: No Stinky bubbles, nice to learn the game mechanics in there, and i think there are more noobs there then in nulsec and probally the fleets are smaller.<br><br>What you  can fly a ship u want too loose, i think everone has a ship in his hangar that he hates, and doubt already for months, shall i trash it or sell it. Now i found the way to get rid of it join me.<br><br>Another option fly a ship u can afford to loose, a frig is great for this they dont cost much and you can have a lot of fun with them. (if u dont can afford a frig call me). Cruizers are better. If u show up in a bs i will kill mysellf because they are too slow. (or i will try)<br><br>when<br>Sunday around 16.00 eve time gathering in Foves. (or a system nearby)<br>fc: i hope someone else will speak, otherwise i will try (but then we all die certenally)<br><br>Die in a group is more fun then alone so join me<br>gr  Bob<br><br>PS: for fitting questions maybe i can help.]]></row>
      <row messageID="298421628"><![CDATA[Greetings all!<br><br>As you might now, we are aspiring to move into nulsec, to be more specific, the CIS area in the Syndicate region, where we have a corporation office.<br><br>Note, it’s NOT mandatory to move there, but we will provide the opportunity!<br><br>-    Why do we want to go to nulsec?<br>Well, miners/industrials and ofcourse PVP’ers in our corporation want more than highsec; more action, killmails, ABC ores, different places to explore and such.<br><br>-    How will we get there?<br>We will work towards our own Jump Freighter to haul things to our corporation. As this is not an option at this time, we have found several solutions.<br>1.    We will buy ships and modules from fellow corporations within the alliance so we can build up a ship-base there.<br>2.    We will work towards our own POS in that system, so we have a place to repair ships and craft things as ammo and drones and offer a place to refine and place safe Cyno (also for alliance members)<br>3.    We will craft POS’s from our PI effort, sell them and use that money to fatten OUR corporation wallet so we can buy YOU ships there. No replacement fund needed as ships and such is already paid for.<br>4.    We will use the same money to buy and maintain a jumpfreighter, which will bring in anything else we need.<br><br>-    But I think…<br>Any ideas and such are welcome.  Please send me a mail with your ideas, wishes etc CLEARLY STATED.<br><br>More will follow.<br>Fly safe, Zav<br>]]></row>

Like Bob hinted at, I've got a few Tristans and Thoraxen I could afford to lose, so if you can't, contact me.<br><br>Another thing: if you get blown up somewhere in low sec, you should be able to get your pod out in 99.9% of the cases. I assume we'll go through that before we leave, if nee<br>d be. But if you're not comfy with the slightest possibility of a clone loss, you might want to jump to a clean clone if you can.<br><br>But again, there's no bubbles in low sec, so if you keep your head somewhat cool, you can almost always get your pod out in a pinch.<br><br>Also, you can dock up at a NPC station to grab a fresh n00b ship. Might not get you phat killz, but at least you won't be naked. =]<br><br>Most importantly, though: it's TONS of fun. Low sec isn't HALF as scary as you might think it is. So if you can spare the time, do yourself a favour and join in. =]<br><br>Oh, and another thing that Bob forgot to mention: it's almost a MUST to have TeamSpeak, because that's what Bob will be using to talk to you.

It really takes off I was thinking that I might be be willing to make this a monthly event and maybe we could put together a prize pool to generate a little bit of participation. It would get players really are familiar with their fitting  and give them an idea of which skills they should be training.  So please e-mail me if you are interested in this I will be checking my mail often. <br><br>If you are interested please reply to me with with what size you would like to run this with example being <br><br>examples of ship sizes:<br><br>frigates<br>cruisers<br>battleships<br><br>example of rules: <br><br>no leaving the grid<br>no bombs<br>no cloaking <br>no warping<br>etc.<br><br>PS if this really takes off you guys will get a better understanding of the game mechanics and what your ships are capable.<br>And since it is on the test server you can get killed 100 times without affecting your game<br>]]></row>
